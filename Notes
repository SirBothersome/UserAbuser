This is a text based game in a C++ file. Due to the potential amount of changes I might add, you may need to compile the c++ file locally
I recommend you get an IDE to build and run it. If you're feeling nerdy, you can also try running it in the command line, 
though I'm yet to test its cross-platform compatibility. Good luck. God Bless and good day
